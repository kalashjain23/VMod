# VMod
## What it does
Helps you in moderating the audio that you gave as an input!

## How we built it
Using the Assembly API and SightEngine API and some basic python functions!

## Challenges we ran into
Dealing with some of the API's was hard!! It took soo much time to get ahead of just integrating the API's!!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finally made a working prototype of the program despite of the troubles with the API!!

## What we learned
How to use different API's (Assembly API and SightEngine API)

## What's next for VMod
A nice interface and fast running API's to work with!

Run the main.py!!!
